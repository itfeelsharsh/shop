Set up Firebase Firestore by following these steps:

2.  Set Firestore rules for secure data access:

 ```json
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                  (request.auth.uid == userId || 
                   get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.userRole == 'Admin');
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                                     get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.userRole == 'Admin';
    }

    match /users/{userId}/cart/{cartItemId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /products/{productId}/reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }

  }
}
```
